# stewrobot-web TODO (Source of Truth)

## Rules
- This file is the single source of truth for daily automation.
- Priority order: P0 > P1 > P2.
- Automation should execute at most 1~2 tasks per run.

## P0 (Now)
- [ ] Mobile board table final polish (column readability + touch behavior)
  - Why: Mobile first impression still inconsistent
  - Done when: no awkward wrapping/overflow on recent iPhone Safari
- [ ] 24/7 detail-view UX polish
  - Why: writing/detail feedback still feels rough
  - Done when: loading/posting state is obvious and stable

## P1 (Next)
- [ ] Numbered pagination for board list (1,2,3...)
- [ ] Server-side real view count integration plan sync with board-server

## P2 (Later)
- [ ] Labs detail page multilingual support
- [ ] Accessibility pass (contrast/focus/aria labels)
